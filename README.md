## 1.Hierarchical Clustering for 25 English Articles
This program uses "word vectors" to count the words in an article. And by calculating the Pearson Correlation Score of two vectors to judge the closeness between two clusters. In every loop, the function will find the best matching clusters and merge them into a new cluster. This process will repeat until there is only one cluster left. Finally we can generate a picture of dendrogram to represent the hierarchical clustering by usint PIL.
