Mid-Autumn Festival is on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. It is one of the most popular traditional festivals in China and other Asian countries. It is a custom to eat mooncakes on this day in China.
One Beijing resident shared a past experience of Mid-Autumn Festival.
"I remember my mother took me on walk out of the hutong and we came to the street. There were dried fruit shops, a dessert shop and small restaurants along the street. There also were some street peddlers.
"Parents would take us to the clay figurine vendor where all kinds of clay dolls could be found there because the Moon Festival was coming. The clay rabbit is a necessity for the day. Some rabbits were holding a flag while some were riding a qilin, or Chinese dragon. Clay rabbits in different shapes and sizes were put on the table and parents would buy their kids the one they loved. Kids and parents brought the clay rabbit home. This is the first thing for the festival."
