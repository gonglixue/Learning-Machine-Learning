The more people, whether they own a GoPro or a smartphone, become visual storytellers, the larger our market share will grow, said Woodman.
After years of investment boom in the drone sector in China, analysts say newcomers have to create new application scenarios to stimulate people's interest.
Jean Xiao, a research manager who tracks drones and virtual reality at IDC China, said the sales of the GoPro drone will increase thanks to the number of GoPro's existing user base and the rise in fans of the brand in the country.
"Compared with other quadcopters, the foldable drone has a higher price tag but is easier to handle," said Xiao. "Meanwhile, due to the limitations of the existing technologies in the consumer drone industry, policy regulations, such as flight duration and altitude, will not pose a big challenge to the device."
Given the superior price and limited differentiation of the product, Xiao predicts that Karma will face a fierce competition with domestic brands in the country's market.
"As performances of drones' CPUs get improved by chipmakers, such as Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia, and also the technology integration with VR and artificial intelligence gets better, the next generation drone will become 'smarter'," she said.
Chris Fang, senior client service executive at another consulting company GfK Retail and Technology China Co Ltd, also noted that the launch of Karma will push forward the brand awareness of GoPro in the consumer drone market.
He said the removable 3-axis camera stabilizer and Karma Grip, which are shipped with the drone and available for capturing smooth handheld and gear-mounted footages, are creative combination rather than innovations.
