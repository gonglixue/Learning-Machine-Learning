The world's first e-commerce satellite is scheduled to be launched in 2017.

According to China Economic Net, Juhuasuan.com, a group shopping website affiliated with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, recently announced plans to launch the world's first e-commerce satellite.

The project is in cooperation with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology and the China Space Museum. The three parties aim to further develop space exploration with the help of both space technology and e-commerce data.

The report said Juhuasuan.com plans to provide consumers with the world's best vegetables after analyzing agricultural cultivation and harvesting data provided by satellites.

"In the future, consumers on the Juhuasuan platform will be able to enjoy high-quality goods that follow the trajectory of the satellites. Lovers' keepsakes can be sent into space," offered Liu Bo, general manager of Juhuasuan.com. He said that the company aims to develop a series of customized products with the help of satellites.

Material that fell from the Shenzhou-11 carrier rocket will be made into daily commodities such as umbrellas, jewel cases and vacuum cups. These goods are expected to be available on Juhuasuan.com from Sept 23 to 25.

The company made the above announcements during its Beijing launch ceremony for the new space marketing plan.
