op overseas schools are expanding their Chinese business as more Chinese parents are pursuing international education for their children, the Associated Press reports.

Nicholas Dwyer, the CEO of a renowned Australian school in China, said the booming demand is based on three things; the attraction of overseas universities, the possibility to speak fluent English and a different type of pedagogy from Chinese schools.

As Chinese parents become more affluent, international schools offer an alternative education for their children. Unlike traditional Chinese schools, international schools are considered by many Chinese parents as less stressful and not as exam focused.

As a result, many international schools are opening more campuses in China despite the high price.

Although they cost far more than traditional Chinese schools, more than 150,000 Chinese students have enrolled in international schools, and education monitors expect that number to grow.

A professor at Beijing Normal University, Zeng Xiaodong, said parents and students who choose international schools still make up a small percentage of the Chinese population, although an upward trend is inevitable and that is good for the Chinese educational system. "It is certainly a result of development that people have diverse preferences for their children's education," said Zeng.
